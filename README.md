## Introduction
A mobile application used to browse through movies built with React Native, Redux and the TMDB API.
This is a personal project I'm currently working on to get started with cross-platform mobile development using React Native.
## Features
* Browsing through movies (released and upcoming)
* Look up movie informations (release date, movie budget, rating, summary, ...)
* Adding movies to a personal Favorite list

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Pre-requisites
Following the React Native [Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) is the best way to get started, here is what you should have installed:
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Expo](https://expo.io/)
### 2. Install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/amadoug2g/Playground
cd Playground
npm install
```
### 3. Get your API key
You can get your TBDM API key by creating an account on their [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
Don't forget to add a `.env` file with the API key, at the root of your project.
### 4. Start your app
```
npm start
```
or
```
expo start
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to run the application on a virtual or physical device.
